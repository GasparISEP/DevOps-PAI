title As a RUC, I want to grade a Student in a Course Edition\nProcess View – Level 2 (with HATEOAS + GET by studentID)

actor "RUC" as RUC
participant ":Frontend" as FE
participant ":Backend" as BE
database DB

== Step 1: Get Course Editions by Student ==

RUC -> FE ++: I want to grade a student
FE --> RUC --: Ask for StudentID
RUC -> FE ++: StudentID = 1102840

FE -> BE ++: HTTP GET /students/1102840/courseeditionenrolments
BE -> DB ++: Find CourseEditions where student is enrolled
DB --> BE --: List<CourseEdition>
BE --> FE --: JSON array of CourseEditionDTOs
FE --> RUC --: Show CourseEdition options

== Step 2: Submit Grade ==

RUC -> FE ++: Fill grade, date, choose CourseEdition
FE -> BE ++: HTTP POST /course-editions/studentgrades/register
note right of BE: Parses JSON into DTO → Command\nValidates enrolment + creates aggregate

BE -> DB ++: INSERT INTO `student_grade`
DB --> BE --: Grade persisted

BE --> FE --: HTTP 201 Created\n+ EntityModel<GradeAStudentResponseDTO> (_links)
FE --> RUC --: Grade submitted with success!
